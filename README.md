# litictactoe

This is a website (idea originating from the great [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/)) to play TicTacToe on. It is planned to come with...

- user accounts,
- a full-blown ELO system,
- analysis mode,
- bot opponents,
- different time controls,
- ... and a lot more random stuff!

As you might've noticed by now, compared to chess, TicTacToe is not a particularly hard game. Indeed, it is solved and does not have any meaningful gameplay to it.

It is not focused on high-quality code or implementations at all, but rather tries to bring the idea of a half-baked platform for... "advanced" Tic-Tac-Toe players into reality as fast as possible.
